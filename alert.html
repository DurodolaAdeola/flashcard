    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: blue;">JavaScript alert()</h1>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic; font-family: georgia;color: blue;">The alert() method in JavaScript is used to
        display a virtual alert box. It is mostly used to give a warning message to the users. It displays an alert
        dialog box that consists of some specified message (which is optional) and an OK button. When the dialog box
        pops up, we have to click "OK" to proceed.

        The alert dialog box takes the focus and forces the user to read the specified message. So, we should avoid
        overusing this method because it stops the user from accessing the other parts of the webpage until the box is
        closed.

        We can understand the usefulness of the alert method using an example. Suppose we have to fill a form for an
        identity card. It asks about the date of birth for the eligibility criteria of the identity card. If the age is
        18 years or above, then the process will continue. Otherwise, it will show a warning message that the age is
        below 18 years. This warning message is the 'Alert Box'.

        Another example is suppose a user is required to fill the form in which some mandatory fields are required to
        enter some text, but the user forgets to provide the input. As the part of the validation, we can use the alert
        dialog box to show a warning message related to fill the textfield.



        Rather than showing the warnings or errors, the alert dialog box can be used for normal messages such as
        'welcome back', 'Hello XYZ', etc.

        Syntax
        alert(message)
        Values
        message: It is an optional string that specifies the text to display in the alert box. It consists of the
        information that we want to show to the users.

        Let's see some examples of the JavaScript alert() method.</h3>

        <h1 style="color: blue; text-align: center;">Example1</h1>
        <h3 style="color: blue;font-family: georgia; font-style: italic;">In this example, there is a simple alert dialog box with a message and an OK button. Here, there is an HTML
        button which is used for displaying the alert box. We are using the onclick attribute and call the fun()
        function where the alert() is defined.</h3>
