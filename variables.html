    <h1 class="jumbotron bg-danger">JavaScript Variables</h1>
    <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables. Variables can
        be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by
        naming the container.

        Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var
        keyword.
        You can also declare multiple variables with the same var keyword.</h4>
    <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Storing a value in a variable is called variable initialization. You can do
        variable initialization at the time of variable creation or at a later point in time when you need that
        variable.
        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">For instance, you might create a variable named money and assign the value
            2000.50 to it later. For another variable, you can assign a value at the time of initialization.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span><b>Note</b></span> − Use the var keyword only for declaration or initialization, once for the life of any variable name in a
        document. You should not re-declare same variable twice.

        JavaScript is untyped language. This means that a JavaScript variable can hold a value of any data type. Unlike
        many other languages, you don't have to tell JavaScript during variable declaration what type of value the
        variable will hold. The value type of a variable can change during the execution of a program and JavaScript
        takes care of it automatically.
    <span><b>Also note</b></span>- var is outdated whereby its not mostly used in code writting, instead of the use of var LET can be used to create a variable</h4>
    <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;">For instance: var = my name you can use let = my name, you'd still get the same output mind you when declaring a variable the let start with a small letter.</h4>
    <h1 class="jumbotron bg-danger">JavaScript Variable Scope</h1>
    <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;">The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes.</h4>
    <ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
        <li><h4><span><b>Global Variables</b></span> − A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code</h4></li>
        <li><h4><span><b>Local Variables</b></span> − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.</h4></li>
    </ul>
